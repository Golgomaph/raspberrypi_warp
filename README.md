# SimpleAudio

This is a inofficial improvment of nico kaisers rpi-audio-receiver.

- Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth support (tested with Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and Zero W) or USB dongle (highly recommended!)
- Raspberry Pi OS Buster Lite (tested with August 2020 version)
- Internal audio, HDMI, USB or I2S Audio adapter (tested with [Adafruit USB Audio Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1475),  [pHAT DAC](https://shop.pimoroni.de/products/phat-dac), and [HifiBerry DAC+](https://www.hifiberry.com/products/dacplus/))
